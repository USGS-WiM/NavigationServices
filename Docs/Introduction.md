Project summary paragraph 2
The Navigation Services API performs multiple high level procedures which include; database queries, geospatial queries and service requests in order to compile and create simple objects that can be consumed by custom client applications. As documented by this page, which can also serve as an URL builder, the Navgation Service API is built following [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) principles to ensure scalability and predictable URLs.
## Getting Started
The URL of each resource can be obtained by accessing one of the resources located to the left.
Every resource is exposed as a URL and follows the outlined pattern described below:
* The description of the resource
* The Service URL.
* URL Parameters (if any).
  * Parameter Name,
  * Value Type,
  * A description of what the parameter represents,
  * Whether the parameter is required or optional,
  * And an example input parameter.
* A REST Query URL test tool that builds an example url, based on the given input parameter values.
* And an example response from the REST Query.
